# Snake Game - Python (Turtle)

This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The objective is to collect red food items while avoiding collisions with the borders or the snake’s own body. The snake grows as it eats, and the score increases accordingly.

## Features

- Classic snake gameplay using Turtle graphics
- Dynamic scoring with high score tracking
- Game Over popup with option to replay or quit
- Simple controls (WASD)
- Custom colors for background, snake, food, and score text

## Controls

- W - Move Up
- S - Move Down
- A - Move Left
- D - Move Right

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pritish2403/SnakeGame.git
Run the game:
python snake_game.py
Note: Make sure Python is installed. No external libraries are required except tkinter, which is bundled with standard Python distributions.

### **Option 2: Convert the Game to Kivy (if you actually want Kivy)**

If your goal is to actually use **Kivy**, I can **convert your Turtle code into Kivy**. Here's what I can provide:

- A fully working `snake_game_kivy.py` using Kivy widgets, Clock scheduling, and keyboard inputs
- Visual styling with Kivy canvas
- Score tracking and game reset popup using `Popup`
- WASD or Arrow key controls
- Matching it exactly to your original Turtle logic

Let me know if you'd like this full **Kivy version**, and I’ll write it for you.
